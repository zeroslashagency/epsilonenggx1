## Trend Analysis
- small: avg runtime basic=24.5ms, advanced=289ms (delta 1079.6%), setupMin basic=0, advanced=162, runMin basic=389.5, advanced=370
- medium: avg runtime basic=17ms, advanced=360ms (delta 2017.6%), setupMin basic=0, advanced=291, runMin basic=1122, advanced=1098
- large: avg runtime basic=56ms, advanced=1068.5ms (delta 1808%), setupMin basic=0, advanced=873, runMin basic=3351.5, advanced=3294

## Key Findings
- Basic mode produces zero setup events/minutes and excludes Setup_output; advanced mode consistently emits setup events/minutes and includes Setup_output.
- Quantity conservation passed for every part and operation: sum(batchQty) equals orderQuantity.
- Piece-level continuity passed for every (part, batch, piece): next operation starts after prior operation ends.
- Personnel_Daily_Full and Utilization_Summary reconcile exactly against Personnel_Event_Log for run/setup minutes and event counts.
