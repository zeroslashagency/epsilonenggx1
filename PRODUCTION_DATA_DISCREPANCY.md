# 🔴 PRODUCTION DATA DISCREPANCY FOUND

**Date:** 2025-11-01 20:33 IST  
**Issue:** Production shows 95/98 records, Localhost shows 117 records  
**Difference:** 19 records missing in production

---

## 📊 COMPARISON:

| Environment | Total Records | Recent Logs | Difference |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Localhost** | 117 | 117 | - |
| **Production** | 98 | 95 | **-19 records** |

---

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION:

### **Test 1: API Response Verification**

**Localhost:**
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/get-attendance?fromDate=2025-11-01&toDate=2025-11-01'
Result: 117 records
```

**Production:**
```bash
curl 'https://epsilonengg.vercel.app/api/get-attendance?fromDate=2025-11-01&toDate=2025-11-01'
Result: 98 records
```

**Difference:** 19 records

## 🔴 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

### **Possible Causes:**

1. **Database Sync Delay**
   - Production database may not have latest records
   - Localhost has newer data synced after production deployment
   - Records synced after production build

2. **Timezone Issue in Production**
   - Vercel runs in UTC timezone
   - Our code calculates IST date: `2025-11-01`
   - But production environment may be interpreting differently
   - Some records may be filtered out due to timezone boundary

3. **Caching in Production**
   - Vercel may be caching API responses
   - Even with `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
   - Cache-Control headers may not be working

4. **Database Connection Difference**
   - Localhost connects to same Supabase
   - Production connects to same Supabase
   - But query execution time differs
   - Records added between queries

---

## 🔍 DETAILED ANALYSIS NEEDED:

### **Check 1: Sync Times**
Need to compare sync_time of records:
- What time were the 19 missing records synced?
- Were they synced AFTER production deployment?

### **Check 2: Production Logs**
Need to check Vercel logs:
- What date range is production actually querying?
- Are there any errors in production logs?

### **Check 3: Database Direct Query**
Query Supabase directly:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM attendance_data 
WHERE log_date >= '2025-11-01 00:00:00' 
  AND log_date < '2025-11-02 00:00:00'
```

---

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. Check when the 19 missing records were synced
2. Check Vercel production logs
3. Verify timezone handling in production
4. Test with explicit timezone in query
5. Check if production is using cached response

---

## ⚠️ IMPACT:

**Severity:** MEDIUM
- Production showing incorrect attendance count
- Users see 95 instead of 117
- Data integrity issue
- Not a code bug, likely deployment/sync timing issue

**Status:** INVESTIGATING
