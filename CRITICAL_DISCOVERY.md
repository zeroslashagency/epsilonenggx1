**Date:** 2025-11-01 19:58 IST  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIX IS WORKING

---

## ‚úÖ ACTUAL TEST RESULTS (FRESH, NO CACHE):

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/get-attendance?dateRange=today' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache'
```

**Result:**
```
Total Records: 114
Recent Logs: 114
All Logs: 114
Time range: 2025-11-01T19:47:18 to 2025-11-01T00:00:06
```

## üîç WHAT HAPPENED:

**My Previous Tests Were CACHED:**
- Earlier curl commands were returning cached responses (6 records)
- Fresh API call with `Cache-Control: no-cache` returns **114 records**
- All records are from 2025-11-01 only ‚úÖ

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION:

### **Current Time:**
- IST: 2025-11-01 19:58
- System working correctly

### **API Response:**
- **114 records** for today (2025-11-01)
- First record: 19:47:18 (latest)
- Last record: 00:00:06 (earliest)
- All from correct date ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ CONCLUSION:

**THE FIX IS WORKING CORRECTLY**

The API is now returning the correct data:
- ‚úÖ 114 records for today
- ‚úÖ All from 2025-11-01
- ‚úÖ No timezone issues
- ‚úÖ IST calculation correct

**My earlier verification showing "6 records" was due to cached curl responses.**

---

## üìã NEXT STEP:

**User should refresh browser (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R) to clear browser cache and see the correct 114 records.**

The system is working correctly now.
