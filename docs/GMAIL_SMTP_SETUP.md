## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### ‚ùå "Invalid credentials" error

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're using the **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
- App Password should be 16 characters with spaces
- Copy it exactly as shown (with or without spaces - both work)

### ‚ùå "Authentication failed" error

**Solution:**
- Verify 2FA is enabled on your Google account
- Generate a new App Password
- Make sure SMTP User is your full email (e.g., `user@gmail.com`)

### ‚ùå Emails not arriving

**Solution:**
- Check spam folder
- Wait 5 minutes (sometimes delayed)
- Check Supabase logs: https://app.supabase.com/project/sxnaopzgaddvziplrlbe/logs/edge-logs
- Try sending to a different email address

### ‚ùå "Less secure app access" message

**Solution:**
- This is old - ignore it
- Use App Passwords instead (Step 2 above)

---

## üìä GMAIL LIMITS

- **500 emails per day** (free Gmail account)
- **2,000 emails per day** (Google Workspace account)
- No hourly limits

**This is plenty for most applications.**

---

## üîí SECURITY NOTES

‚úÖ **App Passwords are safe** - they only work for SMTP, not full account access
‚úÖ **You can revoke** App Passwords anytime at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
‚úÖ **Each app should have its own** App Password
‚úÖ **Never share** your App Password publicly

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION

After setup, you should see in Supabase:
- ‚úÖ "Custom SMTP enabled"
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark next to SMTP settings

Test by sending a password reset email. You should receive it within 1-2 minutes.
