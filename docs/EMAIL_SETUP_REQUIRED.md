# üìß EMAIL CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE

Password reset emails are not being sent because **Supabase email provider is not configured**.

By default, Supabase uses a rate-limited email service that only works for testing. For production, you need to configure your own email provider.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: CONFIGURE EMAIL PROVIDER

### **Option 1: Use Supabase's Built-in Email (Development Only)**

Supabase provides a limited email service for development:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate limited** to 4 emails per hour
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not reliable** for production
- ‚úÖ Works immediately without setup

**This is likely why emails aren't arriving** - you may have hit the rate limit.

---

### **Option 2: Configure Custom SMTP (Recommended for Production)**

#### **Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard**
https://app.supabase.com/project/sxnaopzgaddvziplrlbe/settings/auth

#### **Step 2: Scroll to "SMTP Settings"**

#### **Step 3: Enable Custom SMTP**

#### **Step 4: Configure Your Email Provider**

**Popular Options:**

**A) Gmail (Free)**
```
SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com
SMTP Port: 587
SMTP User: your-email@gmail.com
SMTP Password: [App Password - not your regular password]
Sender Email: your-email@gmail.com
Sender Name: Your App Name
```

**B) SendGrid (Free tier: 100 emails/day)**
```
SMTP Host: smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP Port: 587
SMTP User: apikey
SMTP Password: [Your SendGrid API Key]
Sender Email: noreply@yourdomain.com
Sender Name: Your App Name
```

**C) Mailgun (Free tier: 5,000 emails/month)**
```
SMTP Host: smtp.mailgun.org
SMTP Port: 587
SMTP User: postmaster@your-domain.mailgun.org
SMTP Password: [Your Mailgun SMTP Password]
Sender Email: noreply@yourdomain.com
Sender Name: Your App Name
```

## üß™ TESTING

After configuring SMTP:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for settings to propagate
2. **Click "Send reset email"** in your app
3. **Check spam folder** if not in inbox
4. **Check Supabase logs** at: https://app.supabase.com/project/sxnaopzgaddvziplrlbe/logs/edge-logs

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

‚úÖ **API Working:** Password reset API is functional
‚úÖ **Code Working:** All code is correct
‚ùå **Email Provider:** Not configured (using default rate-limited service)

**Email to test:** mrak9668@gmail.com

---

## üöÄ QUICK FIX FOR TESTING

If you just want to test quickly:

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/sxnaopzgaddvziplrlbe/settings/auth
2. Scroll to "Email Auth"
3. **Disable "Enable email confirmations"** temporarily
4. Now users can sign in without email verification

**Note:** This is only for testing. Re-enable for production.

## üìù ALTERNATIVE: USE MAGIC LINKS

Instead of password reset, you can use magic links:
- No password needed
- User clicks link in email to log in
- More secure than passwords

Already implemented in your app - just needs SMTP configured.
