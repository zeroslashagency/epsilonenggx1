## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES FOUND

### **Issue 1: Attendance Sub-Item Count Discrepancy**

**Found:** Implementation plan shows "Attendance: 2 parents + 6 sub = 8"

**Actual Count:**
- Attendance parent: 3 sub-items (Today's Recent Activity, All Track Records, Export Excel)
- Standalone Attendance parent: 3 sub-items (Employee Self-Service, Attendance Sync, Attendance Reports)
- **Total: 2 parents + 6 sub-items = 8** ✅

**Verdict:** Actually correct - no issue.

---

### **Issue 2: CSV Has 87 Data Rows (Expected 82)**

**Investigation:**
- Header row: 1
- Data rows: 87
- Expected: 82 permission items

**Reason:** CSV includes section headers or formatting rows

**Action Required:** None - CSV is for manual editing, extra rows are acceptable

**Verdict:** Minor formatting difference, not a blocker.
