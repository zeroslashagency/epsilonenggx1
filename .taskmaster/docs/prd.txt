# Epsilon Scheduling System - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Epsilon Scheduling is a comprehensive workforce management system for manufacturing environments. It provides scheduling, attendance tracking, analytics, and role-based access control.

## Current Status
- Authentication & RBAC system: COMPLETE
- Dashboard: IMPLEMENTED
- Schedule Generator: IMPLEMENTED (needs approval workflow)
- Attendance: IMPLEMENTED (needs manual entry)
- Analytics: BASIC (needs enhancement)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Cleanup & Stabilization (2 weeks)
Remove placeholder modules that were never implemented and clean up the codebase.

**Tasks:**
1. Remove Production module from UI (sidebar, routes, components, permissions)
2. Remove Monitoring module from UI (sidebar, routes, components, permissions)
3. Clean up unused permissions (operate_machine, view_reports if unused)
4. Update role editor permission list (remove Production/Monitoring sections)
5. Update documentation (README, FEATURE_MATRIX, PROJECT_STRUCTURE_REPORT)

### Phase 2: Schedule Module Completion (3 weeks)
Add approval workflow and publishing to the schedule generator.

**Tasks:**
6. Add schedule approval database schema (schedule_approvals table, status column)
7. Create schedule approval API (submit, approve, reject, list pending)
8. Add schedule approval UI (submit button, approval queue, status indicators)
9. Implement schedule publishing (publish approved schedules, lock, version history)
10. Add schedule templates (CRUD, apply template, template library)

### Phase 3: Attendance Module Enhancement (2 weeks)
Add manual attendance entry and leave management.

**Tasks:**
11. Add manual attendance entry schema (manual_attendance table, approval workflow)
12. Create manual attendance API (POST, GET, PUT with validation)
13. Add manual attendance UI (manual entry form, bulk entry, approval queue)
14. Implement leave management (request form, approval workflow, balance tracking, calendar)

### Phase 4: Dashboard & Analytics (3 weeks)
Enhance dashboard with customizable widgets and custom report builder.

**Tasks:**
15. Add dashboard widget system (framework, drag-and-drop, widget library, save layouts)
16. Implement dashboard customization (add/remove widgets, resize, themes, export/import)
17. Add custom report builder (query builder, chart types, filters, save reports)
18. Add advanced data export (Excel, PDF, CSV, scheduled exports)

### Phase 5: System Improvements (4 weeks)
Add backup/restore and user impersonation for better system management.

**Tasks:**
19. Implement backup/restore system (database backup, file backup, automated backups, restore, verification)
20. Add user impersonation (impersonate button, session switching, audit logging, exit impersonation, security checks)

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Next.js API Routes
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Authentication: Supabase Auth
- Authorization: Custom RBAC system

## Success Criteria
- All 20 tasks completed
- All features tested and working
- Documentation updated
- No regressions in existing features
